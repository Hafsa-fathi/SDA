          <h2 style="text-align:left;">Literature Survey</h2>
         <p style="text-align:justify;">In this modern world, with the quick improvement of science and innovation, vehicle’s population
getting increased day by day. Along with the vehicle’s population accidents caused by negligence
and ignorance of road signs getting increased. These signs help to maintain traffic order and are
meant to decrease the frequency and severity of road accidents. To protect the safety of the
motorist, traffic signs are put in designated zones. Typically, traffic signs differ slightly between
nations, and they are diversified, with a broad range of colors, forms, and measurements .
However, if driving during a mind-boggling climate or the driver's mental state isn't well, this may
make the main impetus ignore the messages from the traffic sign. Traffic signs have distinctive
features which can be classified into separate sub-categories. These are divided into five main
categories according to shape and color: Warning signs (red triangle), prohibition signs (red
round), reservation signs (rectangular blue), mandatory signs (circular blue), and temporary signs
(yellow triangle). during this study, only the speed signs and thus the stop signs taken into
account as use case studies to measure our approach. In the proposed application, the system will
detect the road sign and alert the driver through voice assistant in real time .</p>

          <h2 style="text-align:left;">Research Gap</h2>
         <p style="text-align:justify;">Nowadays accident is one of the major problems in Sri Lanka. This system will Reduce the
accidents using CNN in real time moving vehicle. In most of the countries, researchers had
proposed systems with different approaches, but we couldn’t find any implemented systems, which
are not helpful for end users. In above mentioned proposed systems, they did not consider all the
factors which are affecting in real world, if they consider main factors then it will be more accurate.
By examining above research, we came up with a solution to solve the problem where above
research projects have failed to solve.

          <h2 style="text-align:left;">Methodology</h2>
         <p style="text-align:justify;">Image processing 2d convolutional neural network is used to create the deep learning model. This
model is classifying images, Due to the availability of the coral accelerator. Which used to capture
and render images quickly for moving vehicles. A novel idea was invented and proposed in the
study, Based on the location of the stop side or either side of the road. The blur found in the vehicle
will be in the opposite direction due to relative velocity.
OpenCV was utilized to reproduce the stimulated effect of moving images in the dataset,
henceforth when the images are converted into NumPy arrays they represent the state of stop
boards captured by a raspberry for moving vehicles. There are many software boundaries are used
for this system. There are NumPy was used for matrix manipulation, OpenCV was used for data
augmentation, TensorFlow and Keres were used to build the convolutional neural network,
Raspberry Pi was used as the IoT device for the data rendering and model capturing. Python Text
to voice synthesis engine was used to generate audio voices whenever the boards were detected.
Data augmentation/preprocessing was done by using the OpenCV python library, all the images
were resized and manipulated by adjusting the thresholds of pixels using Adaptive threshold
algorithms and Images were blurred by using Nearest Pixel algorithm.

          <h2 style="text-align:left;">Research Problem</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
In Sri Lanka existing solution for traffic sign board detection is image identification. Most of the
systems are using CCTV Camera for detecting the images and displayed in the mobile application.
While using these systems there are some problems to drivers; first they want to see the mobile
application while driving, second while they drive the vehicle the camera didn’t capture the image
properly because in the live moving vehicle, they didn’t use CNN so it can’t capture the live
images. In this system there are many new features implement to reduce these problems. CNN,
Keres, Tensor flow were used to increase the accuracy of the system. CNN was used in real time
moving vehicle for capture the traffic sign board accurately. Raspberry pi and mobile applications
are used to give the sign board images details as voice. In this system voice is used to easy driving
for the drivers, they can hear the voice while driving so there is no issues in their journey. </p>
